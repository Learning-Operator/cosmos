Proper distance is the actual distance between two bodies within an expanding universe.

\[
D_p = a(t) \cdot x(t)
\]

Where:
- \( D_p \) is the proper distance
- \( a(t) \) is the scale factor (a measure of the size of the universe, in comparison to that of today, where \( a = 1 \))
- \( x(t) \) is the comoving distance (the fixed coordinate separation between two objects, unaffected by the expansion of the universe)

For an expanding universe, at a given time, the proper distance can also be described by the line element of the **Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric**.

The **Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)** metric for spacetime describes the distance between two points within an expanding universe. The line element of the metric provides you with the proper distance between two objects at a point in time.

\[
ds^2 = -c^2 \, dt^2 + a(t) \cdot (dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2)
\]

Where:
- \( ds \) is the spacetime interval (or proper distance)
- \( a(t) \) is the scale factor
- \( c \) is the speed of light
- \( dt \) is the time differential
- \( dx, dy, dz \) are the spatial differentials along the \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) axes
