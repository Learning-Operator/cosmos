As reported by Scott Dodelson in *Modern Cosmology* (2nd edition), conformal time is given by:

\[
\eta = \int_0^t \frac{1}{a(t)} \, dt
\]

Where: 
- \( t \) refers to cosmic time
- \( a(t) \) refers to the scale factor

Or, alternatively:

\[
\eta = \int_z^\infty \frac{1}{H(z)} \, dz
\]

Where: 
- \( z \) refers to redshift (you can calculate this with the information in `redshift_conversion.md`)
- \( H(z) \) refers to the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift (you can calculate this with the information in `redshift_conversion.md` or `flrw.md`)


Conformal time is another measure of time used to simplify cosmological calculations, particularly when dealing with an expanding universe.
