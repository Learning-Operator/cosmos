The comoving distance between two objects \( x(t) \) is the fixed coordinate separation between two objects, unaffected by the expansion of the universe.
The value of this distance is given by the line element:

\[
ds^2 = -c^2 \, dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2
\]

Where:
- \( ds \) is the spacetime interval (or comoving distance)
- \( c \) is the speed of light
- \( dt \) is the time differential
- \( dx, dy, dz \) are the spatial differentials along the \( x, y, z \) axes

This is for the coordinate distance between two objects within a Euclidean metric.
The 'd' refers to an infinitesimal change in that variable, or difference.
