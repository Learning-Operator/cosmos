Critical density is the energy density required to stop the universe from expanding.

\[
\rho_c = \frac{3 H^2}{8 \pi G}
\]

**Units**: \( \text{kg/m}^3 \)  
*Can be read as kilograms per meter cubed.*

Where:
- \( \rho_c \) is the critical density
- \( \pi \) is approximately 3.141592653589
- \( H \) is the Hubble parameter (you can calculate this with the equations in `cflrw.md` or `redshift_conversion.md`)
